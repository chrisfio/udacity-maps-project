# Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

This project shows our ability to tap into public APIs inorder to produce a custom map. We also make use of Knockout in this project, a popular JavaScript framework. 

This map shows various establishments near where I live. I have included three bars, restaurants and coffee shops. 

## Getting Started

Using this application is fairly simple, download the files contained on this Github repo to your computer. Find the index.html file and open it. This should show you the map of my neighborhood where you will have options to filter by establishment type or hide all restaurants. 

This project can also be found [here](https://hirechris.me/maps/index.html])

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a web browser to view this application, which you likely have since you are reading this file located on Github. If somehow you don't have a web browser, you will need to download one.

## Built With

* [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/index.html) - The web framework used
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [Four Square API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)
